# Talent Hire

Relationship coaching inspired application

Inspired by: [this dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/4486758-Relationship-Coaching-App)

## Challenges
Like other challenges typography is always a challenge. While I tried to get the typography close my time is better spent working on the actual UI. Another challenge I faced was the icons used in the mockup. Both the main appbar icon and the hearts are custom icons so I just replaced them with some generic ones that are similar.
