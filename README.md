# Flutter UI

This is a repository which will contain many UI challenges. Some UI challenges are from tutorials on YouTube and others are made by me. Most of these designs are coming off of [dribbble](https://dribbble.com).

Notes:
- The code in here is not the most efficient or cleanest. These challenges are only meant to take less than an hour or so. Please check out my other flutter projects for more efficient and cleaner code
- Most of these UI's have limited/no functionality
